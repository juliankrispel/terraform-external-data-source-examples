# Terraform external data source examples 

To run any example:

```bash
cd <example>
terraform init
terraform apply
```

For `deploy-lambda-with-latest-deno-layer` you will need an aws account and an AWS profile set up locally, you can do this quite easily with the [aws cli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html).
